Sales Data Analysis Project 📊

In this project, I analyzed sales data using Excel and SQL to extract insights that support business decision-making.

The analysis involved data cleaning and preparation in Excel, mapping product categories using SQL, and performing analytical queries such as total sales, number of orders, sales trends, and category-based performance.

For data visualization, I developed interactive dashboards using Tableau and Excel.
In addition, I used Power BI for data modeling, building analytical measures, and creating a structured dashboard.

Within Power BI, the work included:
- Data modeling and relationships
- DAX measures using CALCULATE
- Time Intelligence analysis (date-based insights)
- Dashboard development
- Visual design enhancement and storytelling

📌 Tools Used:
- Excel (Data Cleaning, Analysis, Dashboards)
- SQL (Data Preparation and Analysis Queries)
- Tableau (Interactive Dashboards)
- Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Time Intelligence, Dashboard Design)

📊 Deliverables:
- SQL queries file
- Cleaned Excel dataset
- Tableau dashboard screenshots
- Excel dashboard screenshots
- Power BI dashboard images
